This Jenkins pipeline is created to directly clone the github repository in the EC2 server. 
The motive is to reduce the data migration time.
The user just have to replace the github credentials and the repository URL and then click on build now to run the jenkins pipeline and it will clone the reporisory from github to the specified EC2 server.
The speed of cloning the repository depends on the size of repository and internet speed.
